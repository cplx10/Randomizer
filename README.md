# Randomizer
A program for those who desire a taste of randomness in their lives!

## About
Being developed by cplx since 2021, the Randomizer is a terminal-based program written in Python which features a few functions related to random results and outcomes, particularly its classic **Randomizer** function, which picks a random event from a list, and **Rolling Dice**, a dice roller introduced with version 2.0 of the program.

Its origin comes from events held in an internet community which required the use of random events, as well as cplx's desire to further explore programming and develop his skills in Python. Many changes have been made over time (which are documented in the update logs downloaded with the Randomizer), improving user experience, bringing new features and expanding the capabilities of the program, all the while keeping its goal of being a hub for randomness.

## Features
The Randomizer contains the two aforementioned functions, which respectivelly do the following:
- the classic Randomizer asks the user to input a list of events and returns a random one for them;
- Rolling Dice asks the user to input a die to roll and... well, rolls a die!

Since early 2024 the program has been getting translations to other languages, namely Portuguese and Spanish (more will come in the future), which can be directly accessed within the program.
Introduced with version 2.0 was also a brand-new feature called **presets**, which allows the user to save, load, edit and delete set lists of dice or Randomizer events saved locally in their computer.
