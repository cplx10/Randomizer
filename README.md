# Randomizer

A program which lets you input a (near) unlimited number of possible results and outputs a random one using a simple Python script.

## A step-by-step guide to how it works
The program displays instructions as you use it, however it usually goes like this:

1. You either choose to start the program or not;
2. Assuming you chose to start, it'll show you an input line for your first event;
3. The program will keep asking for more events until you input "x";
4. It'll display the randomly chosen event among all the ones you typed in and ask if you wish to close it;
5. If you reply with yes it it'll go back to events, otherwise it'll direct you to the closing screen.

In short, just open the program and follow the instructions displayed. Have fun!
